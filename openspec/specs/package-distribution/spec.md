# package-distribution Specification

## Purpose
Define the npm package identity, published file boundary, install safety, dependency boundary, and installed CLI/MCP behavior.
## Requirements
### Requirement: npm package identity
The system SHALL publish the public CLI package as `@mun.digital/cli` with binary name `mundigital`.

#### Scenario: Package is installed
- **WHEN** a user installs the npm package
- **THEN** the `mundigital` binary is available and runs the public CLI

### Requirement: Published file allowlist
The package distribution SHALL include only the CLI binary, package metadata, license/readme, public artifacts, and mirrored shared source modules needed for CLI and MCP behavior.

#### Scenario: Package is prepared
- **WHEN** the npm package is packed or published from the workspace
- **THEN** package preparation rebuilds public profile artifacts before the package contents are assembled

#### Scenario: Package is packed
- **WHEN** the npm package is packed
- **THEN** it includes public resume artifacts, the public Raindrop snapshot, CLI runtime files, and required MCP/profile modules

#### Scenario: Raw private data exists in the repo
- **WHEN** the npm package is packed
- **THEN** it excludes raw profile data, Raindrop config source data, private metadata sources, and unrelated workspace files

### Requirement: Package install is side-effect free
The package distribution SHALL NOT use postinstall behavior or dependencies that introduce private writes, deployment, shell, environment, telemetry, or secret access.

#### Scenario: Package is installed
- **WHEN** the package is installed with scripts ignored or normal npm installation
- **THEN** the install does not require private data, network auth, deployment access, shell side effects, or generated artifact rebuilds

### Requirement: Package dependency boundary
The package distribution SHALL avoid depending on the web app stack.

#### Scenario: Package metadata is inspected
- **WHEN** the packed package is inspected
- **THEN** it does not depend on Next.js, React, React DOM, or private workspace packages for runtime CLI/MCP use

### Requirement: Installed CLI and MCP behavior
The package distribution SHALL preserve public CLI and local stdio MCP behavior after installation.

#### Scenario: Installed package is smoked
- **WHEN** the packed package is installed in a temporary project
- **THEN** `npx mundigital profile`, `npx mundigital brief`, and `npx mundigital mcp` expose sanitized public behavior

### Requirement: Verification
The package distribution contract SHALL be protected by package smoke checks.

#### Scenario: Package verification runs
- **WHEN** maintainers verify package distribution
- **THEN** they run `pnpm run pack:smoke`
